## SQL Challenge

A few things to note before you get started:

* Please do all work for this portion of the exercise in SQL. Any variant of SQL is fine but Postgres is preferred.
* There are blank/null values in the  data set and it reflects the nature of real world data.
* The questions in this portion of the exercise are strictly to demonstrate SQL knowledge, so please take their intent with a grain of salt.

### Instructions

* Use the database created to answer all the questions.
* Provide all code you used to answer questions, set up the db, and import data in the [SQL Directory](/sql/sql)

### Questions

1. How many accounts had usage in November?

2. Produce a sql query that returns the sum of usage.quantity for by month, by country, ranked from most to least.


3. For the month of September, which product had the most usage?


4. Produce a sql query that returns the number of accounts that have performed 3 or more searchtypes in the last 30 days.


## Exploratory Problem

- We have a new director looking for insights and visuals into overall volume trends and geographies. Using the available data, come up with 3 recommendations for the next quarter.

1. What new region do you believe we focus on expanding in and why?

2. Are there any accounts we should focus on expanding?

3. Any other recommendation that stands out to you during your analysis.



## Visualization Challenge

This portion of the exercise is aimed at understanding how you would convey the results of your work to stakeholders. There's no right or wrong choice for this part.

You can do this portion of the exercise in any tool you'd like. Tableau, Excel, Google Sheets, Google Data Studio, or Jupyter Notebook will work.


### Instructions
- Visualize the results from the Exporatory Problem.
- If you're doing your work in excel or google sheets, please clearly label your data sets and provide the resulting file in the [Viz](/viz/analysis) directory.
- If you're doing your work in a cloud based visualization tool or other BI software that is publicly accessible, provide a link to the visualizations in a  file in the [Viz](/viz/analysis) directory.
- If you're doing your work in a visualization tool or other BI software that _isn't_ publicly accessible, provide an artifact that contains the visualizations in the [Viz](/viz/analysis) directory.
- If you're doing your work in a notebook software, provide the resulting file and instructions on how to run  it in the [Viz](/viz/analysis) directory.
- Recommendations should be a brief Word or PowerPoint document.  Analysis can be in excel, sql, or notebook etc.  Both documents can be placed in the [recommendations directory](/viz/recommendations) along with necessary instructions to run the files.
- Please come prepared to present your findings to us in your interview.
